## Project Overview

This lightweight Web application shows the weather for any given location. The application should prompt users for their device's location, but they should also be able to provide the location manually. Temperature, weather conditions, and a generic image will be shown to the user corresponding to that location's weather. Basic requirements are defined in [this freeCodeCamp exercise](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather/) and expanded features and goals are outlined in [our wiki (work in progress)](https://github.com/nashvillefcc/local-weather-app/wiki).

The code on this GitHub repo is for the front-end side of our application. The APIs we will utilize for weather information and other resources are still TBD. The application is currently being written in standard HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.

This is a teaching exercise and not for sale or distribution without acknowledgment from the team members.

## Contribution

We recommend using VS Code as a code editor unless you already have a preferred program. Downloads can be found on [the main VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com) and installation instructions can be found on [their documentation pages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview). We plan to include a VS Code `.code-workspace` file in the repo to standardize the extensions that the team uses.

Open tickets can be found on the Project Board here: https://github.com/nashvillefcc/local-weather-app/projects/1. If you would like to contribute, please inform the team on the Discord channel before beginning work. For each ticket, create a branch to work on and create a Pull Request when it is complete. Anyone is free to review Pull Requests, and project leads will accept and merge the branches.

Our tickets fall into a Feature -> Task hierarchy, where a Feature is a full user story and there are many Tasks per Feature. Tasks are light on detail; there is an expected outcome on each Task but the implementation is up to the contributor. Generally speaking, Tasks are tagged as either UI tickets (primarily HTML and CSS) or JS tickets (primarily Javascript). Dependencies will be noted in the Blockers section of Task tickets, and all Tasks on a Feature and on the board are currently ordered by priority based on these dependencies.

Each Feature and each Task will have their own Git branch. Tasks will be merged into Features by PR and that Feature will be merged into the Develop branch by PR once it's complete.

- Feature branches should follow the naming convention "FEATURE/feature-name-or-short-description"
- Task branches should follow the naming convention "TASK/ticket-name-or-short-description"
